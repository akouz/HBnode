# HBnode AVR64DD32

A small board based on AVR64DD32 is supposed to be used in GBus project instead of Arduino Pro Mini. It has the same size and similar pin-out, but differs by the following:

-- Program memory 64K instead of 32K.

-- Clock frequency 24 MHz instead of 16 MHz (for 5V Arduino Pro Mini board).

-- Custom made bootloader dedicated for operation in HBus environment. HBus device based on HBnode can remotely upload a new firmare via HBus.
